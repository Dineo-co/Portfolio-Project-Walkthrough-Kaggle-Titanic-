The Titanic survival prediction project is a popular and helpful way to practice important data science skills.

##  Data Cleaning

Load the Data: Use pandas to load the Titanic dataset into a table (DataFrame).
Fix Missing Data: Check if any important information, like Age or Cabin, is missing. If it is, either fill in the missing values (e.g., with the average age) or remove the rows if needed.
Convert Data Types: Make sure all the data is in the right format. For example, change "Sex" from "male" and "female" to numbers (0 and 1).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary Stats: Look at simple statistics for things like Age or Fare to understand the data and spot any unusual values.
Visualize the Data: Create charts to show how things like survival relate to other factors, like Passenger Class (Pclass) or Age.
Check for Relationships: Look at how features like Age, Sex, and Pclass are related to survival to find out what might predict survival.

#### Feature Engineering

Convert Categories to Numbers: Turn text categories (like "Sex" or "Embarked") into numbers so the model can understand them.
Create New Features: Make new columns, like "FamilySize" (adding up siblings/spouses and parents/children), which might help predict survival.
Scale Features: If needed, adjust numbers like Age or Fare to be on the same scale for models that are sensitive to size differences.

##### Model Building

Split the Data: Divide the data into two parts: one for training the model and one for testing it.
Choose Models: Start with simple models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees, and later try more complex ones like Random Forests or Support Vector Machines.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques to make sure the model is not overfitting (getting too good on the training data) by testing it on different parts of the data.

###### Model Evaluation

Check Model Performance: Use measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and others to see how well the model is doing.
Tune the Model: Adjust the modelâ€™s settings to improve its performance, using tools like GridSearchCV.
Feature Importance: Find out which features (like Age or Pclass) are most important for predicting survival.
